# Medical Insurance Price Predictor 💡

A Data Science project to predict **medical insurance charges** using regression models based on demographic and health-related data such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the **insurance charges** a person might incur, based on various input features. The model is trained on a real-world dataset and utilizes preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and regression techniques.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (for Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## 📊 Features Used

- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoker (Yes/No)
- Region
- Charges (Target Variable)

## 📈 Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (optional if used)
- Model Evaluation: R² Score, MAE, MSE
